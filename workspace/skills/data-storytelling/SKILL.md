# Data Storytelling

Transform raw data into compelling narratives that drive decisions and inspire action.

## When to Use

- Presenting analytics to executives
- Creating quarterly business reviews
- Building investor presentations
- Writing data-driven reports
- Communicating insights to non-technical audiences

## Core Concepts

### Story Structure

```
Setup (context/baseline) --> Conflict (problem/opportunity) --> Resolution (insights/recommendations)
```

### Narrative Arc

1. **Hook**: Grab attention with surprising insight
2. **Context**: Establish the baseline
3. **Rising Action**: Build through data points
4. **Climax**: The key insight
5. **Resolution**: Recommendations
6. **Call to Action**: Next steps

### Three Pillars

| Pillar | Purpose | Components |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Data** | Evidence | Numbers, trends, comparisons |
| **Narrative** | Meaning | Context, causation, implications |
| **Visuals** | Clarity | Charts, diagrams, highlights |

## Visualization Techniques

### Progressive Reveal
Start simple, add layers:
- Slide 1: "Revenue is growing" [single line]
- Slide 2: "But growth is slowing" [add growth rate]
- Slide 3: "Driven by one segment" [add breakdown]
- Slide 4: "Which is saturating" [add market share]

### Contrast and Compare
Before/After comparisons, side-by-side analysis

### Annotation and Highlight
Call out key events, add threshold lines, highlight regions

## Headlines That Work

```
BAD: "Q4 Sales Analysis"
GOOD: "Q4 Sales Beat Target by 23% - Here's Why"

Formula: [Specific Number] + [Business Impact] + [Actionable Context]
```

## Best Practices

- **Start with the "so what"** - Lead with insight, not methodology
- **Use the rule of three** - Three points, three comparisons
- **Show, don't tell** - Let data speak
- **End with action** - Clear next steps
- **Don't data dump** - Curate ruthlessly
